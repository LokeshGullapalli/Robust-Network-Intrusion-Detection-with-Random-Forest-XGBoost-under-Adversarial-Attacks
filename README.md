# Robust-Network-Intrusion-Detection-with-Random-Forest-XGBoost-under-Adversarial-Attacks

📝 Repository Description:
This project investigates the robustness of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers in the realm of network intrusion detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. By employing the ZOO (Zeroth Order Optimization) adversarial attack from the ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox) library, the study assesses how these models withstand adversarial manipulations.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive encoding, normalization, and handling of categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Model Training: Implementation and hyperparameter tuning of both Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to optimize performance.
Adversarial Attacks: Generation of adversarial examples using the ZOO attack to evaluate model resilience against malicious perturbations.
Performance Evaluation: Detailed classification reports and confusion matrices for both normal and adversarial datasets to measure and compare model effectiveness.
Visualization:
Feature Importance Plots: Highlighting the most influential features in each model.
Confusion Matrix Heatmaps: Visual representations of true vs. predicted classifications under different conditions.
🔍 Purpose:
To enhance the security and reliability of machine learning models in detecting network intrusions, ensuring they remain effective even in the presence of adversarial threats.
